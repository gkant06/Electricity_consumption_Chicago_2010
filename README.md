# An energy analysis for Chicago in 2010 using SQL

This is an analysis of the electricity and gas consumption in Chicago in 2010 using a kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-energy-consumption-patterns-in-chicago). The key aim is to explore the different factors that have a role to play in energy consumption. For example, do commercial buildings consume more energy than residential  buildings? Is there higher electricity or gas consumption during the winters? What is the average per capita energy consumption of the different neighbourhoods?

While this information might not be adequate on its own, it can be crucial in decision-making at a policy level when coupled with other data such as energy produced or demographics.
